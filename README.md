Archived project from 2021/2022 high school com sci class! ðŸ’»

**About**
This is a console-based RPG where the player moves around the board trying to collect the best items possible before encountering the enemy. It's a cute and simple game that was a culminating project for my classmates and I to show off our Java skills!

**How to Run**
This was originally made using Repl.it, and upon trying to recover the files, the website updated some files automatically causing some strange-looking code. However, it still works in the Repl.it workspace. You can likely run it by uploading it to Repl.it yourself or running it in an IDE with Java, though I haven't tested the latter.
